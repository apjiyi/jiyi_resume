<p class="prospect1">
I am seeking for a position as an engineer, particularly research and development.</p>
<p class="prospect2">With my abstract thinking, computer and sciences ability, I am confident in myself to do well in information and technology filed.</p>
<p class="prospect2">Wish you could give me a chance to challenge it. I am eager to be one developer who helps our society to do development and research on information and technology in this cutting edge.</p>

<p class="subheading1">WORK EXPERIENCE</p>
<ul>
    <li><div><p class="subheading2">Calculus and Physics teacher in private tutoring, 2009-present</p></li>
    <p>Simplify the complexity is my strength, I teached calculus for a student who comes with elementary school mathematical ability, after two monthes classes in summer vercation, and begin with polynomial, the student got score above 80 in calculus in the transfer test, and become the first place.</p>
    <p>No one knows everything, I forgot something sometimes, I learnt for the things I don't know, like calculus which applied in economic field, which I have never learnt before, which I need to preview and study for teaching.</p>
    <p>Simplify the complexity is a ability that I can apply into R/D field which is a critical skill.</p></div>
    
    <li><div><p class="subheading2">Consultant / System Engineer in Digicity, 2009-2013</p></li>
    <p>Build up a lot of experience on hardware and software, from maintenance to linux shell, divide in concord.</p>
    <p>I have been trying to find possible chances to expose myself and deal with various kinds of challenges for more experience. I think that is what I am going to do all my life.</p>
